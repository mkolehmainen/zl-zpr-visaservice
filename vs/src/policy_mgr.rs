//! The policy manager is conceived as the one true place where the running visa service
//! can obtain the current policy.  Policy can be updated asynchronously by administrators.
//! A policy update can have many ripple effects on the running visa serivce: visas may no
//! longer be valid, connected actors may be forced to disconnect, services may be taken
//! down, node connections may change etc.
//!
//! The idea here is that clients of the policy will request it with [PolicyMgr::get_current]
//! use it as quickly as possible and then drop it.  In the case of a policy update there
//! should be few processes holding on to an old policy for long.
//!
//! The [libeval::policy::Policy] is designed to be easily cloned (as it is in an Arc) and
//! accessible by concurrent threads.
