//! Periodic authentication-expiry sweep: find connected adapter actors whose
//! authentication has expired, revoke their authentications on the docking
//! node's VSS, and drop them from the actor store — but only after the node
//! positively acks the revocation, so a VSS outage just defers the removal to
//! the next pass.
//!
//! Like `visa_reconciler::revalidate_visas`, the pass is a plain async fn the
//! spawned loop calls, so tests drive single passes directly — no timers in
//! tests. Node actors are out of scope (operator decision on zipline#44):
//! expired nodes are culled at startup by `actor_mgr::refresh_state`.
